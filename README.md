How to Manually Install A Chrome Extension

Download the extension. Usually extensions come packaged as a zip/rar file. Extract the files into their own folder. If the extension is a “.crx” file, this is a format for Chrome extensions which contains all of its data – no need to extract anything.
Give the extension files a permanent home. Chrome will need continual access to these files for the extension to work, so the file path cannot change. This means don’t leave the files on your desktop or downloads folder where you may accidentally tidy them up or delete them later.

In Chrome, navigate to chrome://extensions/Now drag and drop the extension from your file manager anywhere onto the extensions page in Chrome.

Done! The extension is installed and you are ready to go. You can now manage the extension as you would any other, and its icon will appear in the Chrome Menu (if it has one) to the right of the address bar.
